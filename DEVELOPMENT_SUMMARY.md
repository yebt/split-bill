# Squad Bill - Development Summary

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Squad Bill application has been successfully built and is running at **http://localhost:5173**

## What Was Built

### 1. Domain Models & Types (`src/types/domain.ts`)
- **Squad**: Social context containing groups and bills
- **Group**: Collection of people with color identification
- **Person**: Individual with active/inactive status
- **Bill**: Expense record with two types (equal/distributed)
- **Product**: Items in bills with quantity, price, and assignments
- Color palette with 17 predefined colors for groups

### 2. Repository Pattern (`src/repositories/`)
- **storage.ts**: Abstract storage interface for future DB migration
- **LocalStorageAdapter**: Current implementation using browser localStorage
- **squadRepository.ts**: Full CRUD for squads, groups, and people
  - Create, read, update, delete operations
  - Duplicate squad functionality
  - Move people between groups
  - Import/export data
- **billRepository.ts**: Bill and product management
  - Create bills with two split types
  - Add/edit/delete products
  - Assign products to people
  - Exonerate people from bills
  - Calculate bill splits and totals

### 3. State Management (`src/stores/`)
- **squadStore.ts**: Manages squads, groups, and people state
  - Reactive computed properties for current squad
  - Statistics (total people, active people, group count)
  - All CRUD operations exposed as actions
- **billStore.ts**: Manages bills and calculations
  - Real-time bill total calculations
  - Split calculations for equal and distributed modes
  - Squad-level totals aggregation
- **themeStore.ts**: Dark/light mode management
  - System preference detection
  - Manual toggle
  - Persistent theme storage

### 4. UI Components (`src/components/`)
- **BaseButton.vue**: Reusable button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, ghost)
- **BaseCard.vue**: Card container with variants (default, outlined, elevated)
- **BaseInput.vue**: Form input with label, error, and hint support
- **BaseModal.vue**: Modal dialog with header, content, and footer slots
- **ColorPicker.vue**: Color selection component for groups
- **ConfirmDialog.vue**: Confirmation dialog for destructive actions

### 5. Views (`src/views/`)

#### SquadListView.vue
- List all squads with statistics
- Create new squad
- Duplicate squad (copies groups/people, not bills)
- Delete squad with confirmation
- Import/export data (JSON)
- Empty state with call-to-action
- Theme toggle

#### SquadDetailView.vue

- **People & Groups Tab**:
  - Display groups with color indicators
  - Add/edit/delete groups
  - Add/edit/delete people within groups
  - Toggle people active/inactive
  - Move people between groups
  - Visual active/inactive indicators
- **Bills Tab**:
  - List all bills sorted by date
  - Bill type badges (equal/distributed)
  - Quick stats (items count, total amount)
  - Navigate to bill details
- **Summary Tab**:
  - Total expenses per person
  - Grand total
  - Share as text functionality

#### BillCreateView.vue
- Choose bill type (equal or distributed)
- Add/edit/delete products
- For distributed bills: assign products to people
- Exonerate people from the bill
- Real-time split preview
- Form validation
- Responsive product management

#### BillDetailView.vue
- View bill details
- Product list with assignments
- Exonerated people display
- Split breakdown per person
- Share bill details as text
- Delete bill with confirmation

### 6. Routing (`src/router/index.ts`)
- `/` - Squad list (home)
- `/squad/:id` - Squad detail
- `/squad/:id/bill/new` - Create bill
- `/squad/:squadId/bill/:billId` - Bill detail

### 7. Styling
- **UnoCSS** with Tailwind CSS utilities (wind4 preset)
- **Lucide icons** via UnoCSS preset
- Dark mode support with `dark:` prefix
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Custom color palette for groups

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
✅ Squad CRUD operations
✅ Group management with colors
✅ People management (add, edit, delete, move, activate/deactivate)
✅ Bill creation with two split modes
✅ Product management with assignments
✅ Person exoneration per bill
✅ Real-time split calculations
✅ Summary and reporting

### User Experience
✅ Mobile-first responsive design
✅ Dark/light mode with auto-detection
✅ Offline-first (localStorage)
✅ Import/export data (JSON)
✅ Share functionality (text format)
✅ Custom modals (no native confirm)
✅ Form validation and error handling
✅ Loading states and empty states
✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Technical
✅ TypeScript for type safety
✅ Repository pattern for data access
✅ Pinia for state management
✅ Vue Router for navigation
✅ Composition API throughout
✅ Clean architecture
✅ Reusable components
✅ Proper error handling

## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture
- **Domain Layer**: Pure TypeScript types and interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Repositories with storage abstraction
- **State Layer**: Pinia stores
- **Presentation Layer**: Vue components and views

### Repository Pattern Benefits
- Easy to migrate from localStorage to IndexedDB or backend
- Centralized data access logic
- Testable business logic
- Clear separation of concerns

### Component Design
- Atomic design principles
- Reusable base components
- Composition over inheritance
- Props and events for communication
- Slots for flexibility

## Known Issues & Notes

### TypeScript Warnings
- Some "possibly undefined" warnings in repositories (safe due to runtime checks)
- These are strict null check warnings that don't affect functionality
- Can be resolved with non-null assertions or stricter typing if needed

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires modern browser with localStorage support
- ES6+ features used throughout
- No IE11 support

## Testing

- ✅ Move people between groups
- ✅ Create equal split bill
- ✅ Create distributed split bill
- ✅ Exonerate people from bills
- ✅ View bill details
- ✅ View summary
- ✅ Share as text
- ✅ Export data
- ✅ Import data
- ✅ Duplicate squad
- ✅ Delete squad

- ✅ Mobile responsive design

## Future Enhancements (from AGENT.md)

### Planned
- [ ] OCR integration for bill scanning (Gemini API)
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] PWA with service worker
- [ ] Bill photos/receipts storage

### Additional Ideas
- [ ] Payment tracking (who paid, who owes)
- [ ] Settlement suggestions (minimize transactions)
- [ ] Currency conversion
- [ ] Split by percentage
- [ ] Recurring bills/expenses
- [ ] Bill templates
- [ ] Search and filter
- [ ] Statistics and charts
- [ ] Email/SMS sharing
- [ ] QR code for data sharing

## Performance Considerations

### Current State
- Lightweight (no heavy dependencies)
- Fast initial load
- Instant interactions (no network calls)
- Efficient localStorage usage

### Optimization Opportunities
- Lazy load views (already implemented)
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- IndexedDB for better performance with large datasets
- Service worker for true PWA experience
- Image compression for future photo feature

## Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
bun run build
```

### Preview Production Build
```bash
bun run preview
```

### Deployment Options
- Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- No server required
- No environment variables needed
- Just deploy the `dist` folder

## Development Commands

```bash
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run dev          # Start dev server
bun run build        # Build for production
bun run preview      # Preview production build
bun run type-check   # Type check
bun run lint         # Lint and fix
bun run format       # Format code
bun run test:unit    # Run unit tests (when added)
```
